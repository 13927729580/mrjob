mrjob is a Python package that helps you write and run Hadoop Streaming jobs.

mrjob fully supports Amazon's Elastic MapReduce (EMR) service, which allows you
to buy time on a Hadoop cluster on an hourly basis. It also works with your own
Hadoop cluster.

To get started, install with ``pip``::

    pip install mrjob

Then read :ref:`writing-and-running`. Other common documentation destinations
are:

* :ref:`mrjob.conf`
* :ref:`configs-reference`
* :ref:`runners-emr`
* :ref:`tools`
